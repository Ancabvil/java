I am a man who walks alone
At night or strolling through the park
I sometimes feel a little strange
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light ?
At the corner of the room
Have you ever been alone at night
And turned around and no-one's there ?
You find it hard to look again
Watching horror films the night before
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
On dancing shadows from behind.
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there.
I am a man who walks alone.
