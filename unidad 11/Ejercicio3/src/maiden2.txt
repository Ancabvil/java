And when I'm walking a dark road
When the light begins to change
A little anxious when it's dark.
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
You've sensed that something's watching you.
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And as you quicken up your pace
Because you're sure there's someone there.
Debating witches and folklore
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
On dancing shadows from behind.
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there.
I am a man who walks alone.
