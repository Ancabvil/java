I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark.
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
Have you run your fingers down the wall
You've sensed that something's watching you.
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
Thought you heard footsteps behind
When you're searching for the light ?
And as you quicken up your pace
At the corner of the room
Because you're sure there's someone there.
Have you ever been alone at night
Debating witches and folklore
And turned around and no-one's there ?
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You find it hard to look again
On dancing shadows from behind.
Watching horror films the night before
I have constant fear that something's always near
The unknown troubles on your mind
I have a phobia that someone's always there.
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
I am a man who walks alone.
On dancing shadows from behind.
I have constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there.
I am a man who walks alone.
